## C
    int CRYPT_AES_IvSet(
    CRYPT_AES_CTX* aes, 
    const unsigned char* iv
    );

## Description

This function sets the IV that AES will use for later processing.

## Preconditions

The key must be set previously with CRYPT_AES_KeySet.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|aes  |Pointer to context which saves state between calls.  |
|iv |Pointer to buffer holding the initialization vector. |


## Returns

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- 0 - An invalid pointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

Direction, as set previously in CRYPT_AES_KeySet, is preserved.


## Example

    CRYPT_AES_CTX mcAes;
    int           ret;

    strncpy((char*)iv,  "1234567890abcdef", 16);

    ret = CRYPT_AES_IvSet(&mcAes, iv);
