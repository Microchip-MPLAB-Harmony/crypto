# CRYPT_ECC_PublicImport Function

## C
    int CRYPT_ECC_PublicImport(
        CRYPT_ECC_CTX* ecc, 
        const unsigned char* in, 
        unsigned int inSz
    );

## Description

This function imports a public key in ANSI X9.63 format into the ECC context.

## Preconditions

The ECC context must have previously been initialized with a call to CRYPT_ECC_Initialize.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|ecc  |Pointer to context which saves state between calls. |
|in |Input buffer that holds the public key. |
|inSz |Size of the input buffer, in bytes. |

## Returns 

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- MEMORY_E - Memory could not be allocated for the key.
- ASN_PARSE_E - There was a parse error while going through the key.
- 0 - An invalid ppointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

None. 

## Example

    CRYPT_ECC_CTX userB; 
    int           ret;
    byte          sharedA[100];
    unsigned int  aSz = (unsigned int)sizeof(sharedA);
    unsigned int  usedA;

    ret = CRYPT_ECC_Initialize(&userB);
    ...
    ret = CRYPT_ECC_PublicImport(&userB, sharedA, usedA);
