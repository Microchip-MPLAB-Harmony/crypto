# MPLABÂ® Harmony Crypto Library

The Cryptographic Library includes functions to perform encryption, decryption, hashing, authentication, and compression within the embedded application. Random number generation (RNG) functions are also provided.

**Block Ciphers**

The library provides DES, 3DES, and AES for block cipher needs. Depending on the algorithm in use, CBC and CTR modes are supported.

**Public Key Cryptography**

The library provides RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for Public Key Cryptography, and Diffie-Hellman (DH) for key agreement arrangements.

**Hash Functions**

The library provides MD5, SHA, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 for hashing. These functions do not require keys or initialization vectors (IV).

**Random Number Generation Functions**

The library provides functions to generate either a single pseudo-random number, or a block of such numbers

**Library Interface**

The Library Interface routines are divided into various sub-sections, which address one of the blocks or the overall operation of the Cryptographic (Crypto) Library module.
