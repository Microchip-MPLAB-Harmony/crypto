# CRYPT_AES_DIRECT_Decrypt Function

## C
    int CRYPT_AES_DIRECT_Decrypt(
        CRYPT_AES_CTX* aes, 
        unsigned char* out, 
        const unsigned char* in
    );

## Description

This function decrypts one block of data, equal to the AES block size.

## Preconditions

Key and Initialization Vector (IV) must be set earlier with a call to CRYPT_AES_KeySet and CRYPT_AES_IvSet.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|aes  |Pointer to context which saves state between calls.  |
|out |Pointer to buffer to store the results of the decryption. |
|in |Pointer to buffer where the data to decrypt is located. |


## Returns

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- 0 - An invalid pointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

Input and output buffers must be equal in size (CRYPT_AES_BLOCK_SIZE).


## Example

    CRYPT_AES_CTX mcAes;
    int           ret;
    byte          out1[CRYPT_AES_BLOCK_SIZE];
    byte          out2[CRYPT_AES_BLOCK_SIZE];

    strncpy((char*)key, "1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv", 32);
    strncpy((char*)iv,  "1234567890abcdef", 16);

    ret = CRYPT_AES_KeySet(&mcAes, key, 16, iv, CRYPT_AES_ENCRYPTION);
    ret = CRYPT_AES_DIRECT_Decrypt(&mcAes, out2, out1);
