# CRYPT_AES_KeySet Function

## C
    int CRYPT_AES_KeySet(
        CRYPT_AES_CTX* aes, 
        const unsigned char* key, 
        unsigned int keyLen, 
        const unsigned char* iv, 
        int dir
    );

## Description

This function sets the key, IV, and direction (encryption or decryption) that AES will later perform.

## Preconditions

None.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|aes  |Pointer to context which saves state between calls.  |
|key |Pointer to buffer holding the key itself. |
|keyLen | Length of key in bytes. |
|iv |Pointer to buffer holding the initialization vector. |
|dir |Which operation (CRYPT_AES_ENCRYPTION or CRYPT_AES_DECRYPTION). |


## Returns

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- 0 - An invalid pointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

None.


## Example

    CRYPT_AES_CTX mcAes;
    int           ret;

    strncpy((char*)key, "1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv", 32);
    strncpy((char*)iv,  "1234567890abcdef", 16);

    ret = CRYPT_AES_KeySet(&mcAes, key, 16, iv, CRYPT_AES_ENCRYPTION);
