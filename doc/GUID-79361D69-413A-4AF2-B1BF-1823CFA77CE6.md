# CRYPT_ECC_PublicExport Function

## C
    int CRYPT_ECC_PublicExport(
        CRYPT_ECC_CTX* ecc, 
        unsigned char* out, 
        unsigned int outSz, 
        unsigned int* usedSz
    );

## Description

This function takes an ECC public key and exports it in ANSI X9.63 format.

## Preconditions

The context must be initialized previously with a call to CRYPT_ECC_Initialize. The key must also have been constructed with a call to CRYPT_ECC_DHE_KeyMake. A random number generator must have been initialized with a call to CRYPT_RNG_Initialize.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|ecc  |Pointer to context which saves state between calls. |
|out |Buffer in which to store the public key. |
|outSz |The available size of the buffer, in bytes. |
|usedSz |Return value indicating how many bytes were used. |

## Returns 

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- BUFFER_E - The output buffer was too small to store the key. 
- 0 - An invalid ppointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

None.

## Example

    CRYPT_ECC_CTX userA; 
    int           ret;
    byte          sharedA[100];
    unsigned int  aSz = (unsigned int)sizeof(sharedA);
    unsigned int  usedA = 0;

    ret = CRYPT_ECC_Initialize(&userA);
    ret = CRYPT_ECC_DHE_KeyMake(&userA, &mcRng, 32);
    ret = CRYPT_ECC_PublicExport(&userA, sharedA, aSz, &usedA);
