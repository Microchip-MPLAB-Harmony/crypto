# CRYPT_ECC_DSA_HashSign Function

## C
    int CRYPT_ECC_DSA_HashSign(
        CRYPT_ECC_CTX* ecc, 
        CRYPT_RNG_CTX* rng, 
        unsigned char* sig, 
        unsigned int sigSz, 
        unsigned int* usedSz, 
        const unsigned char* in, 
        unsigned int inSz
    );

## Description

This function takes a message digest and signs it using a private ECC key.

## Preconditions

The ECC context must have been initialized with a call to CRYPT_ECC_Initialize. The RNG context must have been initialized with a call to CRYPT_RNG_Initialize. The private key used for the signature must have been imported or created prior to calling this function.

## Parameters

|Parameters  |Description  |
|----|----|
|ecc  |Pointer to ECC context which saves state between calls and holds keys. |
|rng |Pointer to Random Number Generator context. |
|sig |Destination for the signature.|
|sigSz |The max size of the signature, in bytes. |
|usedSz |The resulting size of the signature, in bytes. |
|in |Pointer to the message digest to sign. |
|inSz |The length of the digest, in bytes. |

## Returns

- BAD_FUNC_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.
- 0 - An invalid pointer was not passed to the function.

## Remarks

None.

## Example

    CRYPT_ECC_CTX userA; 
    int           ret;
    byte          sig[100];
    unsigned int  sigSz = (unsigned int)sizeof(sig);
    unsigned int  usedA = 0;

    ret = CRYPT_ECC_Initialize(&userA);
    ...
    // Import or generate private key
    ...
    ret = CRYPT_ECC_DSA_HashSign(&userA, &mcRng, sig, sigSz, &usedA, ourData, CRYPT_SHA_DIGEST_SIZE);
