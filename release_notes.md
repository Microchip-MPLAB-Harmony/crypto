### Known Issues
- PUKCC Is Unsupported - The PUKCC peripheral for the SAME54 family, used for public key cryptography is not support yet.  This peripheral will be supported in future versions.

- The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. Do not press reset button on the Xplained Ultra board while ICD4 is connected to the board.

- Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  Please see the &quot;Configuring the Library&quot; section in the help documentation in the doc folder for this module instead.  Help is available in both CHM and PDF formats.

- ATSAMA5D2C demo applications build with a warning message: ```Warning[Pe111]: statement is unreachable for return ( EXIT_FAILURE ); statement of main() in IAR```

- ECC and RSA software calculations take upwards of 32 kBytes of stack, when using these algorithms with an RTOS plan accordingly.

## Crypto Release v3.2.0
### New Features
- **New part support** - This release introduces initial support for [SAM E54](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit/sam-32-bit-mcus/sam-e-mcus), families of 32-bit microcontrollers and the [SAM A5D2](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit-mpus/microprocessors/sama5/sama5d2-series) family of 32-bit microprocessors.

- **Wolf SSL/TLS Support** - This release introduces initial support for using the [wolfSSL library][https://www.wolfssl.com] for secure communications.  Current support is for the SAM E70.  **Note:** This support will be moved to the net package in the future.
