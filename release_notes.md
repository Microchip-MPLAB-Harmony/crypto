### Known Issues
- The PIC32MZ-W1 public key cryptographic engine uses an asynchronous driver to access its functionality.  wolfCrypt and the Harmony 3 crypto library are both blocking.  To use the PIC32MZ-W1 with wolfCrypt and the Harmony 3 crypto library an RTOS must be used.

- During regeneration of the SAML11 projects the timer callback may be erased.  When regenerating the projects look for the inline comment on the lines that should not be erased

- When starting the MHC with the SAMRH71F20C the MPLAB-X project needs to be set to use SAMRH71F20B, after the MHC has been launched then the MPLAB-X project can be changed back to using the SAMRH71F20C

- The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. Do not press reset button on the Xplained Ultra board while ICD4 is connected to the board.

- Interactive help using the Show User Manual Entry in the Right-click menu for configuration options provided by this module is not yet available from within the MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).

- ATSAMA5D2C demo applications build with a warning message: ```Warning[Pe111]: statement is unreachable for return ( EXIT_FAILURE ); statement of main() in IAR```

- ECC and RSA software calculations take upwards of 32 kBytes of stack, when using these algorithms with an RTOS plan accordingly.
