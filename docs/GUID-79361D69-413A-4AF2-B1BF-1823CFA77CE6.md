# CRYPT\_ECC\_PublicExport Function

**Parent topic:**[MPLABÂ® Harmony Crypto Library](GUID-20F7C343-23D4-42D9-B8C2-A97D4D0EE5CD.md)

## C

```
int CRYPT_ECC_PublicExport(
    CRYPT_ECC_CTX* ecc, 
    unsigned char* out, 
    unsigned int outSz, 
    unsigned int* usedSz
);
```

## Description

This function takes an ECC public key and exports it in ANSI X9.63 format.

## Preconditions

The context must be initialized previously with a call to CRYPT\_ECC\_Initialize. The key must also have been constructed with a call to CRYPT\_ECC\_DHE\_KeyMake. A random number generator must have been initialized with a call to CRYPT\_RNG\_Initialize.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|ecc|Pointer to context which saves state between calls.|
|out|Buffer in which to store the public key.|
|outSz|The available size of the buffer, in bytes.|
|usedSz|Return value indicating how many bytes were used.|

## Returns

-   BAD\_FUNC\_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.

-   BUFFER\_E - The output buffer was too small to store the key.

-   0 - An invalid ppointer was not passed to the function.


## Remarks

None.

## Example

```
CRYPT_ECC_CTX userA; 
int           ret;
byte          sharedA[100];
unsigned int  aSz = (unsigned int)sizeof(sharedA);
unsigned int  usedA = 0;

ret = CRYPT_ECC_Initialize(&userA);
ret = CRYPT_ECC_DHE_KeyMake(&userA, &mcRng, 32);
ret = CRYPT_ECC_PublicExport(&userA, sharedA, aSz, &usedA);
```
