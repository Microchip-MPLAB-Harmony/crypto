**Parent topic:**[MPLABÂ® Harmony Crypto Library](GUID-20F7C343-23D4-42D9-B8C2-A97D4D0EE5CD.md)

## C

```
int CRYPT_ECC_PublicImport(
    CRYPT_ECC_CTX* ecc, 
    const unsigned char* in, 
    unsigned int inSz
);
```

## Description

This function imports a public key in ANSI X9.63 format into the ECC context.

## Preconditions

The ECC context must have previously been initialized with a call to CRYPT\_ECC\_Initialize.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|ecc|Pointer to context which saves state between calls.|
|in|Input buffer that holds the public key.|
|inSz|Size of the input buffer, in bytes.|

## Returns

-   BAD\_FUNC\_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.

-   MEMORY\_E - Memory could not be allocated for the key.

-   ASN\_PARSE\_E - There was a parse error while going through the key.

-   0 - An invalid ppointer was not passed to the function.


## Remarks

None.

## Example

```
CRYPT_ECC_CTX userB; 
int           ret;
byte          sharedA[100];
unsigned int  aSz = (unsigned int)sizeof(sharedA);
unsigned int  usedA;

ret = CRYPT_ECC_Initialize(&userB);
...
ret = CRYPT_ECC_PublicImport(&userB, sharedA, usedA);
```
