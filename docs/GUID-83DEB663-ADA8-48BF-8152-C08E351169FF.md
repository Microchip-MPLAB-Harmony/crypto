**Parent topic:**[MPLABÂ® Harmony Crypto Library](GUID-20F7C343-23D4-42D9-B8C2-A97D4D0EE5CD.md)

## C

```
int CRYPT_AES_IvSet(
CRYPT_AES_CTX* aes, 
const unsigned char* iv
);
```

## Description

This function sets the IV that AES will use for later processing.

## Preconditions

The key must be set previously with CRYPT\_AES\_KeySet.

## Parameters

|Parameters|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|aes|Pointer to context which saves state between calls.|
|iv|Pointer to buffer holding the initialization vector.|

## Returns

-   BAD\_FUNC\_ARG - An invalid pointer was passed to the function.

-   0 - An invalid pointer was not passed to the function.


## Remarks

Direction, as set previously in CRYPT\_AES\_KeySet, is preserved.

## Example

```
CRYPT_AES_CTX mcAes;
int           ret;

strncpy((char*)iv,  "1234567890abcdef", 16);

ret = CRYPT_AES_IvSet(&mcAes, iv);
```
